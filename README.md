## SEPARATED-CRA-ELECTRON-BUILD

An example how to pack static files generated by `create-react-app` into electron with only `electron-builder` without `electron-webpack`.

## scripts

`make instsall`

`make build` -> you should find a `*.dmg` or `*.exe` after this in `builder/dist/Separated CRA electron build example-1.0.0.dmg`

`make clean`

## notes

It works on `macOS Big Sur v11.2.3` and `Windows 10`.

I tested `*.exe` build on windows 10, `git bash` and install windows `make` by [chocolate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32127632/6414615) is useful.
